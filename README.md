# TCC-ML-Word2Vec
Repository of my TCC about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing with Word2Vec

In the branch master have the files that i used to processing the Word2Vec with Gensim and used Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, both with Python.

I haven't started this codes with git, this is the final version of code.

Start the tests with "tutoW2V.py" where i used to learn how use the library Gensim to save a model.
With the file "tutoW2V-2.py" i make the models to use in TCC with Python x64.

The Python x32 not support models too big.
I used try: except: to see what the types make error to save the models.
with x32 only the Size 100, window 5 and 7 and min_count 5 not make a error.
with x64 all goes well.

The corpus used was the dump of Wikipedia of 2017 in portuguese language: only Articles and Titles version.
